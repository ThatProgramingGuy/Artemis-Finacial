# Artemis-Finacial
Artemis Financial was my client and I made sure that whenever I found a vulnerability I would work and to build vulnerability that existed inside of the application. I made sure that all of the vulnerabilities were properly documented and fixed the client. None of it was challenging. I made sure to use the Java Keytool to create secure communications between the client and the server side for Artemis Financial. I made sure to test every single portion of the code to make sure that the clients and product had zero errors. I feel like I can definitely use this as a template for other assignments in the future. One of the very beneficial parts was being able to reuse parts of the code for other parts of the code. And in addition, if an employer wanted my experience from this assignment, I would be able to demonstrate knowledge of checksum Java Keytool and Maven dependency check.
